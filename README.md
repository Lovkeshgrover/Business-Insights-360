# Business Insights 360 - Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware, a leading manufacturer and distributor of computer peripherals, has seen rapid growth across various regions. However, the company’s reliance on traditional Excel-based analytics became a bottleneck, especially in the Latin American market, leading to significant losses. To address this challenge, **Business Insights 360** was initiated to implement a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard** capable of providing real-time insights for data-driven decision-making across various departments.
